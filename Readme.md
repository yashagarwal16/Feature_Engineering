# 🧠 Feature Engineering

## What is Feature Engineering?

**Feature Engineering** is the process of **preparing and improving the data** (features/columns) so that a **machine learning model can learn better** and make more accurate predictions.

---

## 🔍 In Simple Words

It’s like **cleaning, transforming, and creating new data columns** to help the model **understand patterns more easily**.

---

## 📦 Example

You have raw data like:

| Name | Birth Year | Income  |
|------|------------|---------|
| John | 2000       | 50,000  |
| Sara | 1990       | 60,000  |

You can engineer new features like:

- 🎯 **Age** = 2025 - Birth Year  
- 🧮 **Income Group** = High / Medium / Low  
- 🔢 **Scaled Income** = Income divided by 1000  

Now your model can use these **better features** to make smarter decisions.

## 🎯 Why is it Important?

- ✅ Makes models more accurate  
- 🧠 Helps the algorithm focus on the **right patterns**  
- 🚀 Can even improve a **bad model’s** performance

## 🔧 Key Steps in Feature Engineering

```text
Feature Engineering
├── 1. Creation (Make new features)
│   ├── Polynomial Features (x, x², x³, etc.)
│   ├── Interaction Features (feature1 × feature2)
│   └── Aggregation Features (mean, sum, min, max by group)
│
├── 2. Transformation (Change existing feature values)
│   ├── Scaling
│   │   ├── Min-Max Scaling
│   │   └── Standardization (Z-score)
│   ├── Encoding
│   │   ├── One-Hot Encoding
│   │   └── Label Encoding
│   └── Binning (convert numbers to categories)
│       └── Example: Age → Young, Adult, Senior
│
├── 3. Selection (Choose best features)
│   ├── Filter Methods (use stats like correlation)
│   ├── Wrapper Methods (test with models)
│   └── Embedded Methods (use model's feature importance)
│
└── 4. Cleaning (Fix or remove bad data)
    ├── Handle Missing Values
    │   ├── Fill with mean/median/mode
    │   └── Drop rows/columns
    └── Remove Outliers
        └── Use IQR, Z-score, etc.
